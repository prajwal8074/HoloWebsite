    <strong>Privacy Policy</strong> <p>
                  Prajwal Warade built the HoloChat app as
                  a Free app. This SERVICE is provided by
                  Prajwal Warade at no cost and is intended for use as
                  is.
                </p> <p>
                  This page is used to inform visitors regarding my
                  policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal
                  Information if anyone decided to use my Service.
                </p> <p>
                  If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to
                  the collection and use of information in relation to this
                  policy. The Personal Information that I collect is
                  used for providing and improving the Service. I will not use or share your information with
                  anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.
                </p> <p>
                  The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings
                  as in our Terms and Conditions, which are accessible at
                  HoloChat unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy.
                </p> <p><strong>Information Collection and Use</strong></p> <p>
                  For a better experience, while using our Service, I may require you to provide us with notification permission to allow HoloChat to read incoming notifications and display as Chat Heads. The information that I request will be only stored temporary in RAM as long as the Chat Heads are active. This notification information will clear itself as soon as you exit the app or clear the messages. If consent is granted, the sender, message and its reply for each notification will be stored on internal storage.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Security</strong></p> <p>
                  I value your trust in providing us your
                  Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially
                  acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method
                  of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic
                  storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot
                  guarantee its absolute security.
                </p> <p><strong>Links to Other Sites</strong></p> <p>
                  This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on
                  a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note
                  that these external sites are not operated by me.
                  Therefore, I strongly advise you to review the
                  Privacy Policy of these websites. I have
                  no control over and assume no responsibility for the content,
                  privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or
                  services.
                </p> <p><strong>Childrenâ€™s Privacy</strong></p> <!----> <div><p>
                    I do not knowingly collect personally
                    identifiable information from children. I 
                    encourage all children to never submit any personally
                    identifiable information through 
                    the Application and/or Services.
                    I encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor 
                    their children's Internet usage and to help enforce this Policy by instructing 
                    their children never to provide personally identifiable information through the Application and/or Services without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child 
                    has provided personally identifiable information to us through the Application and/or Services, 
                    please contact us. You must also be at least 16 years of age to consent to the processing 
                    of your personally identifiable information in your country (in some countries we may allow your parent 
                    or guardian to do so on your behalf).
                  </p></div> <p><strong>Changes to This Privacy Policy</strong></p> <p>
                  I may update our Privacy Policy from
                  time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page
                  periodically for any changes. I will
                  notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on
                  this page.
